**Start Time**: $(date)
**Session Branch**: ${SESSION_BRANCH}
**Research Focus**: Distributed AI Networks Architecture

## Session Objectives
- [ ] Design next-generation distributed AI safety networks
- [ ] Enhance semantic adaptation for massive scale
- [ ] Develop consensus-free adaptation protocols
- [ ] Architect team collaboration integration points

## Philosophy
"Networks should heal themselves faster than attackers can adapt. Resilience through rapid semantic evolution."

## Session Log
$(date): Research session initiated

## Architecture Goals
- [ ] Zero-downtime network reconfiguration
- [ ] Consensus algorithms for untrusted participants
- [ ] Network topologies that isolate malicious behavior
- [ ] Semantic routing that adapts to trust changes

## Research Questions
- [ ] How do we scale Elena's behavioral detection to millions of nodes?
- [ ] What network topologies maximize Aria's security requirements?
- [ ] How do we meet Yuki's microsecond latency targets?
- [ ] How do we integrate with Sam's kernel-level networking?

## Session Workspace
- network-architecture/ - Distributed system designs
- semantic-adaptation/ - Dynamic network reconfiguration
- consensus-protocols/ - Trust-free coordination algorithms
- integration-planning/ - Team collaboration architectures
