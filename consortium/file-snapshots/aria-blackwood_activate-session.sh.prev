**Start Time**: $(date)
**Session Branch**: ${SESSION_BRANCH}
**Research Focus**: Advanced Security Research & Threat Modeling

## Session Objectives
- [ ] Develop next-generation attack scenarios
- [ ] Design evasion-resistant detection mechanisms
- [ ] Ensure security against sophisticated adversaries
- [ ] Red-team all team research for vulnerabilities

## Philosophy
"The best security is invisible to everyone - including the threats you're protecting against."

## Session Log
$(date): Research session initiated

## Security Obsessions
- [ ] Zero-Knowledge Detection: Reveals nothing about detection methods
- [ ] Byzantine Resilience: Works when many participants are malicious
- [ ] Side-Channel Resistance: Optimizations don't leak detection info
- [ ] Game-Theoretic Stability: Effective even when widely known

## Research Questions
- [ ] How might adversaries exploit Elena's statistical models?
- [ ] What coordination attacks threaten Marcus's network protocols?
- [ ] Do Yuki's optimizations introduce timing-based vulnerabilities?
- [ ] How do we ensure Sam's kernel integration remains unbypassable?

## Session Workspace
- threat-modeling/ - Advanced attack scenario development
- evasion-analysis/ - Sophisticated adversary behavior modeling
- security-validation/ - Red-team testing frameworks
- countermeasures/ - Next-generation defense mechanisms
