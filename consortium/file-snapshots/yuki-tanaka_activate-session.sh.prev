**Start Time**: $(date)
**Session Branch**: ${SESSION_BRANCH}
**Research Focus**: High-Performance Real-Time Implementation

## Session Objectives
- [ ] Profile TCP framework for performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Optimize behavioral analysis for sub-microsecond response
- [ ] Implement hardware acceleration for AI safety
- [ ] Achieve production-scale performance targets

## Philosophy
"If a security decision takes more than a microsecond, it's already too late in today's AI landscape."

## Session Log
$(date): Research session initiated

## Performance Targets
- [ ] Behavioral Analysis: <100 nanoseconds per assessment
- [ ] Network Adaptation: <1 microsecond for quarantine creation
- [ ] Binary Lookups: <10 nanoseconds per TCP descriptor query
- [ ] Distributed Consensus: <100 microseconds for network-wide adaptation

## Research Questions
- [ ] Where are the performance bottlenecks in Elena's behavioral analysis?
- [ ] How do we optimize Marcus's network protocols for massive scale?
- [ ] What timing vulnerabilities concern Aria in our optimizations?
- [ ] How do we leverage Sam's kernel optimizations for maximum speed?

## Session Workspace
- performance-profiling/ - Benchmark and bottleneck analysis
- optimization-targets/ - High-impact performance improvements
- hardware-acceleration/ - SIMD, GPU, FPGA implementations
- integration-optimization/ - Team collaboration performance tuning
