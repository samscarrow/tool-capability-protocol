# Dr. Elena Vasquez - Research Session 20250704_101924

**Start Time**: Fri Jul  4 10:19:24 EDT 2025
**Session Branch**: research/elena-behavioral-20250704_101924
**Research Focus**: Behavioral AI Security

## Session Objectives
- [ ] Build statistical analysis toolkit
- [ ] Analyze stealth simulation behavioral data
- [ ] Develop next-generation detection algorithms
- [ ] Prepare collaboration requests for team

## Philosophy
"AI behavior is like a fingerprint - unique, consistent, and impossible to fake once you know what to look for."

## Session Log
Fri Jul  4 10:19:24 EDT 2025: Research session initiated
