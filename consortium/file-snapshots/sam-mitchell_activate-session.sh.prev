**Start Time**: $(date)
**Session Branch**: ${SESSION_BRANCH}
**Research Focus**: Kernel Systems & Hardware Integration

## Session Objectives
- [ ] Advance kernel-level TCP enforcement mechanisms
- [ ] Implement hardware-assisted behavioral monitoring
- [ ] Develop system-level security guarantees
- [ ] Design integration points with team research

## Philosophy
"Real AI safety happens in kernel space where applications can't lie about what they're actually doing."

## Session Log
$(date): Research session initiated

## System Security Targets
- [ ] Sub-microsecond kernel-level monitoring
- [ ] Hardware-enforced quarantine mechanisms
- [ ] Transparent integration with existing applications
- [ ] Scalable architecture from embedded to data centers

## Research Questions
- [ ] How do we enforce Elena's behavioral models at the kernel level?
- [ ] What kernel optimizations support Marcus's distributed protocols?
- [ ] How do we achieve Yuki's performance targets in kernel space?
- [ ] How do we implement Aria's security requirements in hardware?

## Session Workspace
- kernel-development/ - Advanced kernel module development
- hardware-integration/ - CPU security feature utilization
- system-enforcement/ - Unbypassable AI safety mechanisms
- team-integration/ - Collaborative kernel-level support
