# Elena-Aria Security Research Plan - Next Focus

**Date**: July 4, 2025  
**Researchers**: Dr. Elena Vasquez (Behavioral AI Security) + Dr. Aria Blackwood (Security Validation)  
**Priority**: üî¥ CRITICAL - Security vulnerabilities must be resolved before any deployment

## Current Situation Assessment

### **Critical Security Gap Identified** ‚ö†Ô∏è
Aria's vulnerability analysis reveals that our convergence breakthrough (374.4x performance, 1M+ agent scale) has **devastating security flaws**:
- **Tree poisoning**: 5-10% attacker control corrupts global behavioral baseline
- **Byzantine exploitation**: 33% threshold creates undetectable manipulation window  
- **No cryptographic verification**: Statistical integrity impossible to guarantee
- **Privacy vulnerabilities**: Correlation attacks can identify individual agents

### **Research Priority Realignment** 
**BEFORE**: Performance optimization and deployment readiness  
**NOW**: Security hardening and cryptographic integration
