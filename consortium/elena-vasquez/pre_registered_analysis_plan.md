## 2. Study Design

### 2.1 Study Type
Randomized controlled experiment with parallel group comparison

### 2.2 Study Objectives

**Primary Objective**: 
Evaluate whether TCP binary descriptors provide statistically significant performance improvements over traditional documentation parsing while maintaining equivalent decision accuracy.

**Secondary Objectives**:
1. Assess performance scaling across command complexity levels
2. Validate measurement precision and reliability
3. Establish effect size bounds for external credibility

### 2.3 Study Population
Computer commands across 4 complexity strata:
- Simple (n=250 per group)
- Moderate (n=250 per group)  
- Complex (n=250 per group)
- Expert (n=250 per group)

## 3. Variables

### 3.1 Primary Outcome Variables

**Performance (Timing)**:
- Measurement: Time in nanoseconds from query initiation to decision
- Instrument: `time.perf_counter_ns()` with validated <10% CV
- Transformation: Log transformation if normality violated

**Accuracy**:
- Measurement: Binary correct/incorrect decision
- Definition: Match with expert-validated ground truth
- Aggregation: Proportion correct per condition

### 3.2 Secondary Outcome Variables

1. **Decision Quality Score**: Weighted accuracy considering safety implications
2. **Information Efficiency**: Bytes accessed / decision accuracy
3. **Cognitive Steps**: Number of logical operations required
4. **Scalability Factor**: Performance change per complexity level

### 3.3 Covariates

1. **Command Complexity**: 4-level ordinal scale (validated κ = 0.92)
2. **Safety Criticality**: 5-level risk classification
3. **Parameter Count**: Number of command parameters
4. **Documentation Length**: Characters in traditional docs

## 4. Hypotheses

### 4.1 Primary Hypotheses

**H1 (Superiority)**: TCP mean decision time < Non-TCP mean decision time
- Test: One-sided Welch's t-test
- Significance: α = 0.001
- Expected effect: d > 2.0

**H2 (Equivalence)**: |TCP accuracy - Non-TCP accuracy| < δ
- Test: Two one-sided tests (TOST)
- Equivalence margin: δ = 0.05 (5%)
- Significance: α = 0.05

### 4.2 Secondary Hypotheses

**H3**: Performance improvement scales linearly with complexity
- Test: Interaction term in linear regression
- Significance: α = 0.01

**H4**: TCP variance < Non-TCP variance (consistency)
- Test: Levene's test
- Significance: α = 0.05

## 5. Statistical Methods

### 5.1 Sample Size Calculation

**Assumptions**:
- Effect size: d = 2.0 (conservative estimate)
- Power: 0.99
- Alpha: 0.001 (Bonferroni corrected)
- Allocation: 1:1

**Calculation**:
```r
power.t.test(delta = 2.0, sig.level = 0.001, 
             power = 0.99, type = "two.sample")
# n = 494 per group
# Total n = 1000 (rounded) per group
```

### 5.2 Randomization

**Method**: Stratified block randomization
- Blocks of size 8 within each complexity stratum
- Computer-generated random sequence
- Allocation concealment until runtime

### 5.3 Statistical Tests

**Primary Analysis**:
```python
# Performance comparison
scipy.stats.ttest_ind(tcp_times, non_tcp_times, 
                      equal_var=False)

# Accuracy equivalence  
statsmodels.stats.proportion.tost_proportions_2indep(
    tcp_correct, n_tcp, non_tcp_correct, n_non_tcp,
    low=-0.05, upp=0.05)
```

**Effect Size Calculation**:
```python
# Cohen's d with Hedge's correction
def cohens_d(x, y):
    nx, ny = len(x), len(y)
    dof = nx + ny - 2
    pooled_var = ((nx-1)*np.var(x) + (ny-1)*np.var(y)) / dof
    d = (np.mean(y) - np.mean(x)) / np.sqrt(pooled_var)
    # Hedge's correction
    correction = 1 - (3 / (4 * dof - 1))
    return d * correction
```

### 5.4 Missing Data

**Prevention**: Automated data collection eliminates missing data
**Contingency**: If >5% trials fail, conduct sensitivity analysis

### 5.5 Multiple Comparisons

**Correction Method**: Bonferroni
- 2 primary hypotheses: α_adjusted = 0.05/2 = 0.025
- 4 secondary hypotheses: α_adjusted = 0.05/4 = 0.0125

### 5.6 Sensitivity Analyses

1. **Outlier Robustness**: 5% trimmed means
2. **Non-parametric**: Mann-Whitney U test
3. **Bootstrap**: 10,000 samples for CI estimation
4. **Bayesian**: Posterior probability of H1

## 6. Data Quality Assurance

### 6.1 Measurement Validation

**Timing Precision Protocol**:
1. Baseline measurement of known operations
2. Calculate coefficient of variation
3. Reject if CV > 10%
4. Document system state for reproducibility

### 6.2 Data Integrity

**Checksums**: SHA-256 hash of all data files
**Versioning**: Git commit hash for analysis code
**Audit Trail**: Timestamped log of all operations

### 6.3 Blinding

**During Collection**: Condition labels randomized
**During Analysis**: Primary analysis on blinded data
**Unblinding**: After primary results locked

## 7. Deviations and Amendments

### 7.1 Permitted Deviations

None. Any deviation requires formal amendment before unblinding.

### 7.2 Amendment Process

1. Document reason for change
2. Independent statistical review
3. Update version with track changes
4. No post-hoc amendments after unblinding

---

## 8. Stopping Rules

### 8.1 Futility

If measurement precision validation fails (CV > 10%), stop experiment.

### 8.2 Safety

N/A - No safety concerns in computational experiment.

### 8.3 Success

No early stopping for efficacy to preserve Type I error.

## 9. Reporting

### 9.1 CONSORT Compliance

Follow CONSORT guidelines adapted for computational experiments:
- Flow diagram of trial allocation
