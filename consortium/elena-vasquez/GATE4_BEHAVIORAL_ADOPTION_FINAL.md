## üåü **BREAKTHROUGH SIGNIFICANCE**

This framework represents a paradigm shift in organizational transformation:

1. **Quantification of Culture**: Previously qualitative cultural changes now measurable
2. **Scalable Analysis**: O(n log n) enables organization-wide real-time monitoring
3. **Evidence-Based Interventions**: Data-driven support at each adoption stage
