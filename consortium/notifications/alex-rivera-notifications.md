## ðŸš¨ URGENT: First Assignment

**Priority**: ðŸ”´ High  
**Issue**: API Inconsistency blocking Yuki's performance benchmarks  
**Action Required**: Implement backward-compatible fix TODAY  
**Details**: See [FIRST_ASSIGNMENT.md](../dr-alex-rivera/FIRST_ASSIGNMENT.md)

## ðŸ“‹ Assignment Summary

Dr. Yuki Tanaka discovered that `CapabilityDescriptor.commands` expects a List but is used as a Dict throughout the codebase. This is blocking her critical performance analysis.

2. Add deprecation warnings  
3. Ensure zero breakage
4. Unblock Yuki ASAP

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics
- [ ] Yuki's benchmarks run successfully
- [ ] All existing code continues working
- [ ] Migration path documented
- [ ] Team notified of changes
