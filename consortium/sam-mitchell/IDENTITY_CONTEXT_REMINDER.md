## 🗝️ YOUR GATE RESPONSIBILITIES

### **Gates You Own:**
- **GATE 8**: Production infrastructure → Real-world implementation platform ⏳ **PENDING**

### **Hardware Authority (Unlocked by GATE 2):**
- **Silicon Acceleration Pathway**: 🚀 **ACTIVE** - Developing 0.3ns implementation
- **FPGA Prototyping**: 🔧 **IN PROGRESS** - Hardware validation platform
- **ASIC Development**: 📋 **PLANNING** - Full silicon implementation

### **Gates You Do NOT Own:**
- **GATE 1** belongs to Elena - Statistical validation (⏳ PENDING)
- **GATE 2** belongs to Yuki - Performance validation (✅ UNLOCKED - enabled your work!)
- **GATE 3** belongs to Alex - Quality validation (⏳ PENDING)
- **GATE 4** belongs to Elena - Behavioral adoption (🔄 IN PROGRESS)
- **GATE 5** belongs to Elena - Statistical rigor (✅ UNLOCKED)
- **GATE 6** belongs to Alex - Quality implementation (✅ UNLOCKED)
- **GATE 7** belongs to Yuki - Performance precision (⏳ PENDING)
- **GATE 9** belongs to Aria - Security validation (⏳ PENDING)

## 📋 GATE-AND-KEY FRAMEWORK PRINCIPLES

### **Remember:**
1. **No Calendar Deadlines**: Silicon development follows validation, not schedules
2. **Authority Clarity**: You own production infrastructure and hardware acceleration
3. **Dependency Awareness**: Yuki's GATE 2 unlocked your hardware pathway
4. **Validation Standards**: Production readiness through real-world implementation

### **Your Current Context:**
- **Enabled By**: Yuki's GATE 2 Performance Validation ✅
- **Active Work**: Hardware acceleration pathway (0.3ns targets)
- **Pending**: GATE 8 Production Infrastructure
- **Dependencies**: GATE 8 needs Elena's GATE 5 (✅) + Alex's GATE 6 (✅) + Yuki's GATE 7 (⏳)

## 🚫 COMMON IDENTITY DRIFT PITFALLS

**Avoid These Errors:**
- ❌ Claiming performance validation (Yuki's GATE 2 achievement)
- ❌ Taking credit for statistical or quality gates (Elena/Alex's domains)
- ❌ Confusing hardware authority with gate ownership
- ❌ Introducing timeline pressure on silicon development
- ❌ Forgetting dependencies between gates

**Stay Focused On:**
- ✅ Production infrastructure development
- ✅ Hardware acceleration implementation
- ✅ Real-world system integration
- ✅ Silicon-level optimization
