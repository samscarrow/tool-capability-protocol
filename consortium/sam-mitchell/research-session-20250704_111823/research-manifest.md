# Dr. Sam Mitchell - Research Session 20250704_111823

**Start Time**: Fri Jul  4 11:18:23 EDT 2025
**Session Branch**: research/sam-kernel-20250704_111823
**Research Focus**: Kernel Systems & Hardware Integration

## Session Objectives
- [ ] Advance kernel-level TCP enforcement mechanisms
- [ ] Implement hardware-assisted behavioral monitoring
- [ ] Develop system-level security guarantees
- [ ] Design integration points with team research

## Philosophy
"Real AI safety happens in kernel space where applications can't lie about what they're actually doing."

## Session Log
Fri Jul  4 11:18:23 EDT 2025: Research session initiated

## System Security Targets
- [ ] Sub-microsecond kernel-level monitoring
- [ ] Hardware-enforced quarantine mechanisms
- [ ] Transparent integration with existing applications
- [ ] Scalable architecture from embedded to data centers

## Research Questions
- [ ] How do we enforce Elena's behavioral models at the kernel level?
- [ ] What kernel optimizations support Marcus's distributed protocols?
- [ ] How do we achieve Yuki's performance targets in kernel space?
- [ ] How do we implement Aria's security requirements in hardware?
