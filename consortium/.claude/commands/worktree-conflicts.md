Check for potential file conflicts between active Git worktrees in the TCP Research Consortium.

This command analyzes:
- Files modified in each worktree compared to main branch
- Overlapping file edits between researchers
- Potential merge conflicts before they occur

Use this before starting work to ensure your changes won't conflict with other researchers' active sessions.
