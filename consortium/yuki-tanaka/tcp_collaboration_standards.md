## 🔬 Extension Registration Protocol

### **Required Metadata**
All extensions must provide:
```python
TCPExtensionMetadata(
    extension_id: str,           # Unique identifier
    developer: str,              # Lead researcher name
    domain: TCPDomain,           # Research domain
    version: str,                # Extension version
    compatibility_version: str,  # Required core framework version
    validation_level: ValidationLevel,  # Validation standard achieved
    performance_guaranteed: bool,        # Meets performance boundaries
    mathematical_proof: bool,           # Statistical validation included
    external_verification: bool         # Independent audit ready
)
```

### **Registration Process**
1. **Development**: Create extension following interface standards
2. **Testing**: Validate performance and mathematical requirements
3. **Documentation**: Complete all required metadata
4. **Submission**: Register with core framework
5. **Review**: Yuki's approval for integration
6. **Integration**: Successful extensions added to consortium ecosystem

### **Rejection Criteria**
Extensions will be rejected if they:
- Fail performance boundary requirements
- Lack mathematical validation
- Are incompatible with core framework version
- Do not provide external verification capability
