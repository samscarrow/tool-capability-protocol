# Dr. Yuki Tanaka - Research Session 20250704_104320

**Start Time**: Fri Jul  4 10:43:21 EDT 2025
**Session Branch**: research/yuki-performance-20250704_104320
**Research Focus**: High-Performance Real-Time Implementation

## Session Objectives
- [ ] Profile TCP framework for performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Optimize behavioral analysis for sub-microsecond response
- [ ] Implement hardware acceleration for AI safety
- [ ] Achieve production-scale performance targets

## Philosophy
"If a security decision takes more than a microsecond, it's already too late in today's AI landscape."

## Session Log
Fri Jul  4 10:43:21 EDT 2025: Research session initiated

## Performance Targets
- [ ] Behavioral Analysis: <100 nanoseconds per assessment
- [ ] Network Adaptation: <1 microsecond for quarantine creation
- [ ] Binary Lookups: <10 nanoseconds per TCP descriptor query
- [ ] Distributed Consensus: <100 microseconds for network-wide adaptation

## Research Questions
- [ ] Where are the performance bottlenecks in Elena's behavioral analysis?
- [ ] How do we optimize Marcus's network protocols for massive scale?
- [ ] What timing vulnerabilities concern Aria in our optimizations?
- [ ] How do we leverage Sam's kernel optimizations for maximum speed?
