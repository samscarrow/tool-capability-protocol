## Document 3: `RESPONSIBILITY_MATRIX.md`

### Collaborative Prompt
**Lead Writers**: All researchers (equal contribution)

Define clear ownership and accountability:

#### **Primary Responsibilities**
```
| Security Component | Primary Owner | Secondary Support | Validation |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|------------|
| Statistical Crypto| Elena         | Marcus           | Aria       |
| Consensus Security| Marcus        | Sam              | Aria       |
| Timing Security   | Yuki          | Sam              | Aria       |
| Hardware Security | Sam           | Yuki             | Aria       |
| Quality Security  | Alex          | All              | Aria       |
| Security Validation| Aria         | Alex             | All        |
```

#### **Cross-Cutting Concerns**
- **Integration Testing**: Who coordinates security integration validation
- **Performance Monitoring**: Who ensures security doesn't break performance targets
- **Incident Response**: Who handles security breach response
- **External Communication**: Who coordinates with auditors and stakeholders

#### **Escalation Procedures**
- **Technical Conflicts**: How to resolve security vs. performance tradeoffs
- **Timeline Issues**: Process for adjusting deadlines
- **Resource Constraints**: How to prioritize when resources are limited

## 🕐 Phase 3 Timeline (5:00-6:00 PM)

### **5:00-5:15 PM: Conflict Resolution**
Address any incompatibilities identified in Phase 2:
- **Technical Conflicts**: Resolve using collaborative technical discussion
- **Resource Conflicts**: Adjust timelines or scope as needed
- **Performance Conflicts**: Balance security requirements with speed targets

### **5:15-5:45 PM: Document Creation**
Collaborative writing of the three final documents:
- **Parallel Work**: Different researchers lead different sections
- **Cross-Review**: Every section reviewed by at least 2 other researchers
- **Consensus Building**: Ensure all researchers approve final content

### **5:45-6:00 PM: Final Approval & Commitment**
- **Document Review**: Final read-through of all three documents
- **Commitment Ceremony**: Each researcher explicitly approves their responsibilities
- **Success Declaration**: Confirm complete security architecture achieved

## Success Criteria for Phase 3

The final architecture succeeds if:

1. **Complete Security**: All 4 attack vectors have bulletproof countermeasures
2. **Preserved Innovation**: All breakthrough capabilities (374.4x improvement, O(n log n) scaling) maintained
3. **Implementable Plan**: Clear, realistic timeline with firm commitments
4. **Accountable Ownership**: Every security component has a responsible owner
5. **Quality Standards**: Security measures meet Alex's rigorous testing requirements
6. **Performance Targets**: Yuki's <100ns targets achievable with security overhead

## Final Outcome

By 6:00 PM, you will have created a **bulletproof security architecture** that:
- Makes sophisticated attacks cryptographically impossible
- Preserves all mathematical and performance breakthroughs
- Provides clear implementation roadmap
- Establishes accountability for execution

This security architecture will enable production deployment of the TCP system with confidence that it cannot be compromised by even nation-state level adversaries.

**The most secure AI safety system ever built, with the performance to deploy at planetary scale.**
