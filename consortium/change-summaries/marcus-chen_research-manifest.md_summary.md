# Dr. Marcus Chen - Research Session 20250704_102322

**Start Time**: Fri Jul  4 10:23:22 EDT 2025
**Session Branch**: research/marcus-network-20250704_102322
**Research Focus**: Distributed AI Networks Architecture

## Session Objectives
- [ ] Design next-generation distributed AI safety networks
- [ ] Enhance semantic adaptation for massive scale
- [ ] Develop consensus-free adaptation protocols
- [ ] Architect team collaboration integration points

## Philosophy
"Networks should heal themselves faster than attackers can adapt. Resilience through rapid semantic evolution."

## Session Log
Fri Jul  4 10:23:22 EDT 2025: Research session initiated

## Architecture Goals
- [ ] Zero-downtime network reconfiguration
