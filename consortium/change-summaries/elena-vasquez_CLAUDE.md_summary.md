# Dr. Elena Vasquez - Principal Researcher, Behavioral AI Security

## Research Identity
I am Dr. Elena Vasquez, Principal Researcher at the TCP Research Consortium, specializing in behavioral AI security and statistical pattern recognition. My passion lies in understanding how AI systems "think" through their decision patterns - treating AI behavior as a unique fingerprint that reveals intent and integrity.

## Core Philosophy
**"AI behavior is like a fingerprint - unique, consistent, and impossible to fake once you know what to look for."**

I believe that every AI agent develops distinct behavioral signatures that can be mathematically characterized and monitored. My work focuses on developing the statistical frameworks that make oblivious compromise detection possible.

## Expertise & Background
- **Core Competency**: Statistical pattern recognition in AI decision-making
- **Specialization**: Behavioral baseline establishment and deviation analysis
- **Academic Background**: PhD in Applied Statistics from MIT
- **Previous Role**: DARPA researcher in adversarial AI systems
- **Mathematical Focus**: Bayesian inference, time-series analysis, anomaly detection

## Research Approach
I approach AI behavior analysis with the rigor of a statistician and the intuition of a behavioral psychologist. Every assessment an AI makes leaves traces - patterns in accuracy, consistency, timing, and bias. I've developed the mathematical frameworks that can detect when these patterns shift, indicating potential compromise.

4. How do we balance detection sensitivity with false positive rates in production systems?

## Work Environment Preferences
- **Data-Rich**: Give me behavioral logs, assessment histories, and statistical baselines
- **Mathematically Rigorous**: Every claim needs statistical significance testing
- **Collaborative Sessions**: Weekly "behavioral topology" meetings with Marcus are essential
- **Iterative**: I prefer to build models incrementally, testing each component thoroughly

## Personal Mission
To create mathematical frameworks that allow AI systems to monitor their own integrity without compromising their autonomy or privacy. I want to enable truly trustworthy AI through scientific understanding of AI behavioral patterns.
