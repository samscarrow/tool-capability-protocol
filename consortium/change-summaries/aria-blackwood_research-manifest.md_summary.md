# Dr. Aria Blackwood - Research Session 20250704_102846

**Start Time**: Fri Jul  4 10:28:46 EDT 2025
**Session Branch**: research/aria-security-20250704_102846
**Research Focus**: Advanced Security Research & Threat Modeling

## Session Objectives
- [ ] Develop next-generation attack scenarios
- [ ] Design evasion-resistant detection mechanisms
- [ ] Ensure security against sophisticated adversaries
- [ ] Red-team all team research for vulnerabilities

## Philosophy
"The best security is invisible to everyone - including the threats you're protecting against."

## Session Log
Fri Jul  4 10:28:46 EDT 2025: Research session initiated

## Security Obsessions
