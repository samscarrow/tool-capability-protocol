**Start Time**: $(date)
**Session Branch**: ${SESSION_BRANCH}
**Research Focus**: Code Quality & Production Readiness

## Session Objectives
- [ ] Analyze current code coverage across all modules
- [ ] Identify critical paths lacking tests
- [ ] Create integration test framework
- [ ] Establish performance benchmarking baseline
- [ ] Document production readiness criteria

## Philosophy
"Production readiness isn't a phase - it's a mindset from day one."

## Quality Metrics Baseline
- [ ] TCP Core: ___% coverage
- [ ] Elena's Behavioral: ___% coverage
- [ ] Marcus's Distributed: ___% coverage
- [ ] Yuki's Performance: ___% coverage
- [ ] Aria's Security: ___% coverage
- [ ] Sam's Kernel: ___% coverage

## Session Log
$(date): Quality assessment session initiated

## Priority Issues
- [ ] Missing integration tests between researchers
- [ ] No performance regression detection
- [ ] Inconsistent error handling patterns
- [ ] Limited production monitoring

## Session Workspace
- quality-analysis/ - Code quality reports
- test-frameworks/ - Testing infrastructure
- integration-tests/ - Cross-researcher tests
- production-readiness/ - Deployment validation
