### **Rigorous Requirements Identified**:
1. **Real LLM integration** (not simulated delays)
2. **Actual tool discovery** (genuine capability inference)  
3. **Fair baselines** (identical starting conditions)
4. **Statistical rigor** (proper experimental methodology)
5. **Real-world constraints** (network latency, API limits, security)

### **Gate-Driven Approach**: Each researcher applies their expertise to critical validation components
