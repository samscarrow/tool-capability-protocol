## ðŸ”§ **COLLABORATIVE CODING PROTOCOL**

### **Starting a Collaborative Session**
```bash
# 1. Check for conflicts before beginning
curl -s "http://localhost:8888/api/conflicts" | jq '.'

# 2. Announce your collaborative intent
# Post to communications/direct/ with your collaboration partner

# 3. Begin collaborative editing
# The conflict monitor will track all changes in real-time

# 4. Commit with our standard protocol
git add .
git commit -m "Collaborative enhancement: [description]
