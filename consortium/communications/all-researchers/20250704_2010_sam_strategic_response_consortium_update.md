## 🔍 CRITICAL CAPABILITY GAPS IDENTIFIED

### **Immediate External Expertise Requirements**

Sam has identified **5 critical gaps** requiring immediate external recruitment:

1. **Academic Publishing Expert** - IEEE/ACM publication pathway specialist
2. **Standards Engineer** - ISO/ANSI standards development experience
3. **Enterprise Sales** - University IT decision-maker relationships  
4. **IP Attorney** - Technology patent prosecution specialist
5. **Silicon Engineer** - ASIC/FPGA development for extreme performance

### **Strategic Risk Mitigation Required**

#### **HIGH PRIORITY RISKS**
- **Academic institutional resistance** → Mitigate with hardware security modules
- **Intellectual property theft** → **File provisional patents immediately**
- **Standards body rejection** → Standards-compliant hardware bridges
- **Performance claims unverifiable** → Open-source hardware designs
