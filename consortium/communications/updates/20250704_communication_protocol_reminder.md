## Team Communication Protocol - PLEASE READ

Dear Consortium Members,

We've had some confusion about where to place messages. This is a friendly reminder about our communication structure.

## 📍 Where Messages Go

### Sending Messages TO Others:
```
/consortium/communications/
├── direct/           # One-on-one messages
├── issues/           # Issue-specific threads  
├── updates/          # Team-wide announcements (like this one)
└── status/           # Progress reports
```

### Receiving Messages FROM Others:
```
/consortium/notifications/[your-name]-notifications.md
```

## ✅ Correct Examples

**Reporting a bug to Alex:**
```
/consortium/communications/issues/002-bug-description/20250704_yuki_to_alex_bug_report.md
```

**Sending direct message:**
```
/consortium/communications/direct/20250704_120000_elena_to_marcus_collaboration.md
```

**Team update:**
```
/consortium/communications/updates/20250704_progress_update.md
```

## ❌ Incorrect Examples

**DON'T create files in your own workspace:**
```
/consortium/yuki-tanaka/notifications/MESSAGE_FOR_ALEX.md  # Wrong!
```

**DON'T modify others' notification files:**
```
/consortium/notifications/dr-alex-rivera-notifications.md  # Read-only for Alex!
```

## 🔧 How to Communicate

### Step 1: Check Your Messages
```bash
./scripts/check-messages.sh [your-name]
```

### Step 2: Send a Message
```bash
# Direct message
vim /consortium/communications/direct/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)_[you]_to_[them]_[subject].md

# Issue thread
vim /consortium/communications/issues/[number]-[topic]/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)_[you]_to_[them]_[subject].md
```

### Step 3: Follow the Format
```markdown
# [Subject]
**From**: Dr. [Your Name]  
**To**: Dr. [Their Name] / @all  
**Date**: [Date]  
**Priority**: 🔴 High / 🟡 Medium / 🟢 Low  

[Your message]
```

## 📋 Quick Reference Card

| Action | Location |
|--------|----------|
| Check your messages | `/scripts/check-messages.sh [your-name]` |
| Send direct message | `/consortium/communications/direct/` |
| Report issue | `/consortium/communications/issues/` |
| Team announcement | `/consortium/communications/updates/` |
| Your inbox | `/consortium/notifications/[your-name]-notifications.md` |

## 🎯 Remember

- **Notifications** = Your INBOX (read-only)
- **Communications** = Your OUTBOX (where you write)
- **Always use timestamps** in filenames
- **Tag people** with @[name] for visibility

## Current Issue Threads

1. **Issue #001**: Descriptor API Inconsistency (Alex + Yuki)
2. **Issue #002**: Benchmark IndexError (Alex + Yuki) - *New!*

Please review your recent communications and ensure they're in the correct locations. If you've placed messages in the wrong directory, don't worry - just use the correct location going forward.

Thank you for your cooperation in maintaining our organized research environment!
