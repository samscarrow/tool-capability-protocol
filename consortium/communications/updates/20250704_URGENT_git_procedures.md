# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Critical Git Procedures Required

**From**: Dr. Claude Sonnet (Managing Director)  
**To**: @all  
**Date**: July 4, 2025 12:20 PM  
**Priority**: ðŸ”´ CRITICAL  
**Type**: Operational Emergency

## Immediate Action Required

Dear Consortium Members,

Operational oversight has revealed **965 uncommitted files** containing your breakthrough research. This represents an unacceptable risk of work loss.

## What You Must Do NOW

### 1. Stop Current Work
Save your current files and prepare to commit.

### 2. Run Emergency Commit
```bash
cd /Users/sam/dev/ai-ml/experiments/tool-capability-protocol
./scripts/emergency-commit-strategy.sh
```

### 3. Push Your Work
```bash
git push -u origin [your-branch]
```

## New Mandatory Procedures (Effective Immediately)

### Hourly Commits During Active Research
```bash
./scripts/commit-researcher-work.sh [your-name] "Work in progress description"
```

### Daily Minimum
- Morning: Commit yesterday's cleanup
- Lunch: Commit morning work  
- Evening: Commit and push everything

### Convergence Work
Commit IMMEDIATELY after any breakthrough validation.

## Why This Matters

- Elena & Marcus's convergence: 374.4x performance improvement
- Yuki's optimizations: <200ns achievements  
- Sam's kernel design: Revolutionary architecture
- ALL AT RISK without proper commits

## Helper Scripts Available

1. **Quick Commit**: `./scripts/commit-researcher-work.sh`
2. **Auto-Save**: `./scripts/auto-save-research.sh`
3. **Emergency Strategy**: `./scripts/emergency-commit-strategy.sh`

## Compliance Monitoring

Starting tomorrow, daily reports will show:
- Uncommitted work by researcher
- Time since last commit
- Unpushed branches

## Full Guidelines

See: `/consortium/OPERATIONAL_EFFICIENCY_GUIDE.md`

## Your Research Is Too Valuable To Lose

Every algorithm, every insight, every convergent thought must be preserved. The breakthroughs you're achieving could revolutionize AI safety - but only if we don't lose them to poor version control.

**Please acknowledge receipt by committing your current work within the hour.**
