## üìä YOUR CRITICAL EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN TASKS

### **1. Rigorous Experimental Protocol Design**

**Current Issue**: Mock scenarios with artificial delays  
**Your Authority**: Design genuine experimental methodology

**Required Experimental Elements**:
1. **Hypothesis Definition**
   - Null hypothesis: No significant difference between TCP and LLM agent performance
   - Alternative hypothesis: TCP agents demonstrate superior capability discovery
   - Effect size expectations based on theoretical framework

2. **Sample Size Determination**
   - Power analysis for detecting meaningful differences
   - Multiple comparison corrections for various metrics
   - Statistical power targets (typically 80%+)
   - Type I and Type II error control

3. **Randomization Protocols**
   - Task order randomization
   - Tool selection randomization
   - Environment randomization
   - Counterbalancing strategies

4. **Control Variable Identification**
   - Computational resources (CPU, memory, network)
   - Starting knowledge base (identical for both agents)
   - Tool availability and documentation
   - Environmental factors (time of day, system load)

### **2. Fair Baseline Methodology**

**Critical Requirement**: Both agents must start from identical conditions  
**Your Expertise**: Ensure experimental fairness and validity

**Baseline Validation Protocol**:
1. **Identical Knowledge Sources**
   - TCP descriptors generated from same documentation LLM uses
   - Verify no information advantage for either agent
   - Document knowledge parity verification methods
   - Establish knowledge baseline measurement protocols

2. **Equal Computational Resources**
   - Standardized hardware environments
   - Identical API rate limits and quotas
   - Equal network bandwidth and latency conditions
   - Comparable optimization levels for both implementations

3. **Fair Comparison Metrics**
   - Task completion accuracy measurement
   - Time-to-completion with proper statistical timing
   - Resource utilization (API calls, tokens, compute)
   - Error rate and recovery measurement

### **3. Statistical Validation Framework**

**Your Domain**: Ensure results are statistically defensible  
**External Impact**: Academic publication and audit readiness

**Statistical Methodology Requirements**:
1. **Significance Testing Protocol**

   - Multiple comparison corrections (Bonferroni, FDR)
   - Effect size calculations (Cohen's d, eta squared)
   - Confidence interval reporting standards

2. **Variance Analysis**
   - Within-group and between-group variance analysis
   - Repeated measures considerations
   - Heteroscedasticity testing and corrections
   - Outlier detection and handling protocols

3. **Reproducibility Standards**
   - Random seed management for reproducible results
   - Cross-validation protocols
   - Independent replication requirements
   - Statistical reporting standards (APA, academic journals)
