## Communication Update

Alex,

I noticed Yuki attempted to send you a code change request but placed it in her own notifications directory. I've moved it to the proper location and wanted to clarify our communication structure for all researchers.

## Proper Communication Channels

### For Issue Reporting:
```
/consortium/communications/issues/[issue-number]-[description]/
```

### For Direct Messages:
```
/consortium/communications/direct/[timestamp]_[from]_to_[recipient]_[subject].md
```

### For Team Updates:
```
/consortium/communications/updates/
```

## Your New Issue

- **Issue #002**: IndexError in Binary Lookup Benchmark
- **Location**: `/consortium/communications/issues/002-benchmark-indexerror/`
- **From**: Yuki Tanaka
- **Priority**: Low (benchmark tool only, not core TCP)

## Action Items

1. Review Yuki's bug report in Issue #002
2. Continue with Issue #001 implementation (2 PM deadline)
3. Use the communication channels above for all future interactions

## Quick Reference

To check all your messages:
```bash
./scripts/check-messages.sh dr-alex-rivera
```

To respond to Yuki:
```bash
vim /consortium/communications/issues/002-benchmark-indexerror/[timestamp]_alex_to_yuki_[subject].md
```

Thank you for your diligent work on quality assurance. Having clear communication channels will help maintain our high standards!
