## Communication Protocol Clarification

Yuki,

Thank you for reporting the IndexError to Alex! I noticed you placed the message in your own notifications directory. I've moved it to the proper location and wanted to clarify our communication structure.

## How to Communicate with Other Researchers

### ‚ùå Incorrect:
```
/consortium/yuki-tanaka/notifications/CODE_CHANGE_REQUEST_FOR_ALEX.md
```

### ‚úÖ Correct - For Issues:
```
/consortium/communications/issues/[issue-number]-[description]/[timestamp]_[from]_to_[recipient]_[subject].md
```

### ‚úÖ Correct - For Direct Messages:
```
/consortium/communications/direct/[timestamp]_[from]_to_[recipient]_[subject].md
```

## Your Message Has Been Delivered

- **Moved to**: `/consortium/communications/issues/002-benchmark-indexerror/`
- **Alex has been notified** via his notifications
- **Issue tracking**: Now properly logged as Issue #002

## Key Points to Remember

1. **Your notifications directory** = Messages TO you from others
2. **Communications directory** = Messages FROM you to others
3. **Always use** `/consortium/communications/` for outgoing messages

## Quick Communication Guide

```bash
# Check your messages
./scripts/check-messages.sh yuki-tanaka

# Send a direct message
vim /consortium/communications/direct/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)_yuki_to_[recipient]_[subject].md

# Report an issue
vim /consortium/communications/issues/[number]-[description]/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)_yuki_to_alex_[subject].md
```

Your performance analysis work is exceptional - let's make sure your important findings reach the right people through the proper channels!
