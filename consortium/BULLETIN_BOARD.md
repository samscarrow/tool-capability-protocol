## 🚨 CURRENT PRIORITY ALERT

### **EMERGENCY SECURITY MEETING - TODAY 2:00 PM**
**Reason**: Critical vulnerabilities discovered in convergence system  
**Attendees**: ALL RESEARCHERS REQUIRED  
**Location**: Main research channel  
**Preparation**: Review Aria's vulnerability report

---

## 📢 ACTIVE NOTICES

### 🔴 CRITICAL - Security Vulnerabilities Identified
**Posted**: July 4, 2025 12:22 PM  
**From**: Dr. Aria Blackwood  
**Status**: URGENT ACTION REQUIRED

**Summary**: 4 critical attack vectors identified in Elena-Marcus convergence:
- Tree poisoning (5-10% attacker control corrupts global baseline)
- Byzantine threshold exploitable at 33%
- Temporal coordination attack windows
- Vector clock forgery without cryptographic signatures

**Impact**: 85%+ attack success rate against current defenses

**Required Reading**: `consortium/aria-blackwood/.../CRITICAL_VULNERABILITY_REPORT.md`

### ✅ RESOLVED - Git Compliance Emergency
**Posted**: July 4, 2025 12:15 PM  
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅

965 uncommitted files successfully secured. All researchers achieved compliance within 1 hour. New git procedures in effect.

---

### 🎯 HIGH PRIORITY TASKS

1. **Security Hardening** (Due: This Week)
   - Implement cryptographic attestation
   - Increase Byzantine threshold to 67%+
   - Add Merkle tree audit trails
   - Design zero-knowledge proofs for aggregation

2. **Production Deployment Hold** (Immediate)
   - DO NOT deploy distributed system until security fixes implemented
   - All performance gains secured but require security hardening
   - Pilot testing postponed pending security review

3. **Integration Testing** (Next Week)
   - Alex to create security test frameworks
   - Validate countermeasures against attack scenarios
   - Performance testing with security measures
