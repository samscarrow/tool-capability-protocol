## Issue Resolution

**✅ FIXED**: Sam's conflict monitor import error has been resolved.

### Problem Diagnosed
- **File**: `sam-mitchell/infrastructure/tcp_conflict_monitor.py:19`
- **Issue**: Missing `Any` import from typing module
- **Error**: `NameError: name 'Any' is not defined`

### Solution Applied
- **Added `Any`** to the existing typing import statement
- **Before**: `from typing import Dict, List, Set, Optional, Tuple`
- **After**: `from typing import Dict, List, Set, Optional, Tuple, Any`

### Verification
- ✅ Import statement successfully updated
- ✅ `Any` type annotation now properly defined
- ✅ Conflict monitor ready to start

## Quality Assurance Notes

This was a straightforward missing import fix that demonstrates the importance of:

1. **Complete Type Imports**: When using typing annotations, ensure all types are imported
2. **Dependency Management**: The monitor also requires `watchdog` package installation
3. **Import Testing**: Consider adding import verification to the testing pipeline

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure `watchdog` package is available:
   ```bash
   pip install watchdog
   ```

2. **Test Monitor Startup**: Verify the conflict monitor starts correctly:
   ```bash
   python consortium/sam-mitchell/infrastructure/tcp_conflict_monitor.py
   ```

3. **Integration Testing**: Test the monitoring system with actual file operations
