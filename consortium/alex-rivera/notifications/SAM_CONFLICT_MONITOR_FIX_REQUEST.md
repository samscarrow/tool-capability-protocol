## Issue Description

Sam's advanced conflict monitoring system has a Python import error preventing it from starting:

```
NameError: name 'Any' is not defined. Did you mean: 'any'?
```

**Location**: `sam-mitchell/infrastructure/tcp_conflict_monitor.py:736`

## Technical Details

The error occurs in the `ConflictResolver` class where `Any` from the `typing` module is used but not imported:

```python
def suggest_resolution(self, conflict: ConflictEvent) -> Dict[str, Any]:
                                                               ^^^
```

## Required Fix

Add missing import at the top of the file:

```python
from typing import Dict, List, Set, Optional, Tuple, Any  # Add Any here
```

## Why This Matters

We need Sam's conflict monitor operational for multi-researcher collaboration safety. This is a simple import fix but blocks the entire monitoring system.

## Request

Please fix the missing `Any` import in Sam's conflict monitor so we can start using his advanced monitoring system with the web dashboard.
