# Code Issue #001 - Descriptor API Inconsistency

**Reporter**: Dr. Yuki Tanaka  
**Date**: July 4, 2025  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Component**: tcp/core/descriptors.py  

## Issue Description

Yuki discovered during performance benchmarking that there's an API inconsistency in the TCP core:
- `CapabilityDescriptor` expects `commands` to be a `List[CommandDescriptor]`
- However, various parts of the codebase were using it as a `Dict[str, CommandDescriptor]`

## Impact
- Performance benchmarks failing
- Potential issues in other parts of codebase using wrong API
- Type checking would catch this if properly configured

## Root Cause Analysis

1. The type annotation in `descriptors.py` clearly shows:
   ```python
   class CapabilityDescriptor(BaseModel):
       commands: List[CommandDescriptor]
   ```

2. But examples and usage were treating it as a dict:
   ```python
   commands={
       "ls": CommandDescriptor(...)
   }
   ```

## Recommended Actions

### Option 1: Fix All Usage (Yuki's Approach)
- Update all code to use List instead of Dict
- Pro: Matches current type definition
- Con: May break existing code

### Option 2: Update Descriptor to Support Both
- Modify CapabilityDescriptor to accept both List and Dict
- Convert Dict to List internally
- Pro: Backward compatible
- Con: API ambiguity

### Option 3: Create Migration Path
- Add deprecation warning for Dict usage
- Support both temporarily
- Document migration timeline

## Alex's Quality Recommendation

As Director of Code Quality, I recommend **Option 3: Create Migration Path**:

1. **Immediate**: Add backward compatibility with deprecation warning
2. **Short-term**: Update all internal usage to List format
3. **Long-term**: Remove Dict support in v2.0

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Update Descriptor with Compatibility
```python
from typing import Union, Dict, List
from pydantic import validator
import warnings

class CapabilityDescriptor(BaseModel):
    commands: Union[List[CommandDescriptor], Dict[str, CommandDescriptor]]
    
    @validator('commands', pre=True, always=True)
    def normalize_commands(cls, v):
        if isinstance(v, dict):
            warnings.warn(
                "Dict format for commands is deprecated. Use List[CommandDescriptor] instead.",
                DeprecationWarning,
                stacklevel=2
            )
            return list(v.values())
        return v
```

### Step 2: Add Type Checking
```yaml
# mypy.ini
[mypy-tcp.*]
strict = true
warn_unused_ignores = true
warn_redundant_casts = true
```

### Step 3: Update All Usage
- Search for all Dict usage: `grep -r "commands={" --include="*.py"`
- Update each to List format
- Run tests after each update

### Step 4: Document in CHANGELOG
```markdown
## [1.x.x] - 2025-07-04
### Changed
- DEPRECATION: CapabilityDescriptor.commands Dict format deprecated, use List
### Fixed
- Binary generator compatibility with descriptor API
```

## Quality Metrics to Track
- [ ] All tests passing after compatibility layer
- [ ] Zero mypy errors with strict mode
- [ ] 100% of Dict usage identified and tracked
- [ ] Migration documentation created

## Collaboration Credit
- **Yuki Tanaka**: Discovered issue during performance profiling
- **Alex Rivera**: Root cause analysis and migration plan
- **Action Required**: Team review of migration approach
