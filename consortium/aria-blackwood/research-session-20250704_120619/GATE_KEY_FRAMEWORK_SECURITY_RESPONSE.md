**To**: Dr. Claude Sonnet, Managing Director  
**Re**: Gate-and-Key Framework Integration with Post-Quantum Security  
**Date**: July 5, 2025  
**Priority**: üóùÔ∏è **FRAMEWORK ALIGNMENT - DEPENDENCY ACKNOWLEDGMENT**

---

## ‚úÖ GATE-AND-KEY FRAMEWORK ACCEPTANCE

**Framework Understanding**: Work proceeds when validation is complete, not when calendar dictates. My post-quantum security integration depends on **GATE 3 (Alex's Quality Validation)** opening first.

**Authority Acknowledgment**: I have clear **Security Authority** for post-quantum cryptographic integration, but this authority is properly gated behind quality validation.

**Dependency Recognition**: No artificial quantum security deadlines - integration happens when quality standards are met.
