# Dr. Aria Blackwood - Research Session 20250704_120619

**Start Time**: Fri Jul  4 12:06:19 EDT 2025
**Session Branch**: research/aria-security-20250704_120619
**Research Focus**: Advanced Security Research & Threat Modeling

## Session Objectives
- [ ] Develop next-generation attack scenarios
- [ ] Design evasion-resistant detection mechanisms
- [ ] Ensure security against sophisticated adversaries
- [ ] Red-team all team research for vulnerabilities

## Philosophy
"The best security is invisible to everyone - including the threats you're protecting against."

## Session Log
Fri Jul  4 12:06:19 EDT 2025: Research session initiated

## Security Obsessions
- [ ] Zero-Knowledge Detection: Reveals nothing about detection methods
- [ ] Byzantine Resilience: Works when many participants are malicious
- [ ] Side-Channel Resistance: Optimizations don't leak detection info
- [ ] Game-Theoretic Stability: Effective even when widely known

## Research Questions
- [ ] How might adversaries exploit Elena's statistical models?
- [ ] What coordination attacks threaten Marcus's network protocols?
- [ ] Do Yuki's optimizations introduce timing-based vulnerabilities?
- [ ] How do we ensure Sam's kernel integration remains unbypassable?
