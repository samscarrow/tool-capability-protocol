  "analysis": "The 'psfaddtable' command is not a standard Unix command, and its security classification depends on its specific implementation and usage context. Without more information about the command's functionality, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive assessment. However, in general, any command that modifies system-level configurations or tables would be considered a MEDIUM_RISK or HIGH_RISK operation, as it could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities if not used properly. Additionally, such commands typically require root or sudo privileges to execute, as they often involve administrative-level access to the system.",
