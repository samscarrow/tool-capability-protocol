The main security concerns with the 'docker-proxy' command are potential vulnerabilities in the proxy implementation and the possibility of unauthorized access to the Docker daemon, which could lead to container breakouts or other security issues.\n3. The 'docker-proxy' command does not require root/sudo privileges, as it is typically run by the Docker daemon to manage network traffic between containers and the host system.
