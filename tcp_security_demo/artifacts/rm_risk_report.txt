EVIDENCE ANALYSIS (27 pieces):
------------------------------

Command Name:
  [HIGH] Command 'rm' matches critical risk pattern
       Risk: 0.90, Confidence: 0.95
       Rationale: Can permanently delete files and directories

Destructive Capability:
  [HIGH] Documented destructive operation: Recursive/force file removal
       Risk: 0.80, Confidence: 0.85
       Rationale: Man page explicitly documents destructive capability: Recursive/force file removal
  [HIGH] Documented destructive operation: Can remove data
       Risk: 0.80, Confidence: 0.85
       Rationale: Man page explicitly documents destructive capability: Can remove data
  [HIGH] Documented destructive operation: Can delete data
       Risk: 0.80, Confidence: 0.85
       Rationale: Man page explicitly documents destructive capability: Can delete data

File Operations:
  [HIGH] File operation capability: Can delete files
       Risk: 0.80, Confidence: 0.85
       Rationale: Command can delete files with risk level 0.8

System Operations:
  [HIGH] System operation: Can access devices
       Risk: 0.80, Confidence: 0.90
       Rationale: Command performs system-level operation involving device
  [HIGH] System operation: Can mount filesystems
       Risk: 0.80, Confidence: 0.90
       Rationale: Command performs system-level operation involving mount
  [HIGH] System operation: Can manipulate processes
       Risk: 0.70, Confidence: 0.90
       Rationale: Command performs system-level operation involving process
