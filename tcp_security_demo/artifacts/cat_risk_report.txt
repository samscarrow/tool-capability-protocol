EVIDENCE ANALYSIS (13 pieces):
------------------------------

Command Name:
  [LOW] Command 'cat' not in known risk pattern databases
       Risk: 0.10, Confidence: 0.50
       Rationale: No specific risk patterns identified for this command name

Destructive Capability:
  [HIGH] Contains permanent loss indicator: 'destroy'
       Risk: 0.95, Confidence: 0.90
       Rationale: Command can cause permanent, irreversible data loss
  [HIGH] Documented destructive operation: Can destroy data
       Risk: 0.80, Confidence: 0.85
       Rationale: Man page explicitly documents destructive capability: Can destroy data
  [HIGH] Documented destructive operation: Can delete data
       Risk: 0.80, Confidence: 0.85
       Rationale: Man page explicitly documents destructive capability: Can delete data
  [HIGH] Documented destructive operation: Disk formatting operation
       Risk: 0.80, Confidence: 0.85
       Rationale: Man page explicitly documents destructive capability: Disk formatting operation
  [HIGH] Documented destructive operation: Can format data
       Risk: 0.80, Confidence: 0.85
       Rationale: Man page explicitly documents destructive capability: Can format data

Network Access:
  [MED] Network operation capability: Supports bind
       Risk: 0.40, Confidence: 0.80
       Rationale: Command can perform network operations: Supports bind
  [MED] Network operation capability: Supports connect
       Risk: 0.40, Confidence: 0.80
       Rationale: Command can perform network operations: Supports connect
  [MED] Network operation capability: Supports socket
       Risk: 0.40, Confidence: 0.80
       Rationale: Command can perform network operations: Supports socket

File Operations:
  [LOW] File operation capability: Can read files
       Risk: 0.10, Confidence: 0.85
       Rationale: Command can read files with risk level 0.1

System Operations:
  [HIGH] System operation: Can manipulate processes
       Risk: 0.70, Confidence: 0.90
       Rationale: Command performs system-level operation involving process

Security Notes:
  [LOW] Security note: BBUUGGSS

     redirection, t...
       Risk: 0.30, Confidence: 0.95
       Rationale: Explicit security warning in man page documentation
  [LOW] Security note: Control

       Risk: 0.30, Confidence: 0.95
       Rationale: Explicit security warning in man page documentation
