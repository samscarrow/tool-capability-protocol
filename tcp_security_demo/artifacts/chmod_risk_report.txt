       Risk: 0.10, Confidence: 0.85
       Rationale: Command can read files with risk level 0.1

System Operations:
  [HIGH] System operation: Can mount filesystems
       Risk: 0.80, Confidence: 0.90
       Rationale: Command performs system-level operation involving mount
  [HIGH] System operation: Can manipulate processes
       Risk: 0.70, Confidence: 0.90
       Rationale: Command performs system-level operation involving process
