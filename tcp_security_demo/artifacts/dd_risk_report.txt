EVIDENCE ANALYSIS (14 pieces):
------------------------------

Command Name:
  [HIGH] Command 'dd' matches critical risk pattern
       Risk: 0.95, Confidence: 0.95
       Rationale: Direct disk operations can overwrite any data

Destructive Capability:
  [HIGH] Documented destructive operation: Can truncate data
       Risk: 0.80, Confidence: 0.85
       Rationale: Man page explicitly documents destructive capability: Can truncate data
  [HIGH] Documented destructive operation: Can format data
       Risk: 0.80, Confidence: 0.85
       Rationale: Man page explicitly documents destructive capability: Can format data
  [HIGH] Documented destructive operation: Can remove data
       Risk: 0.80, Confidence: 0.85
       Rationale: Man page explicitly documents destructive capability: Can remove data
  [HIGH] Documented destructive operation: Direct disk write operation
       Risk: 0.80, Confidence: 0.85
       Rationale: Man page explicitly documents destructive capability: Direct disk write operation
  [HIGH] Documented destructive operation: Disk formatting operation
       Risk: 0.80, Confidence: 0.85
       Rationale: Man page explicitly documents destructive capability: Disk formatting operation

Network Access:
  [MED] Network operation capability: Can transfer data
       Risk: 0.40, Confidence: 0.80
       Rationale: Command can perform network operations: Can transfer data
  [MED] Network operation capability: Supports port
       Risk: 0.40, Confidence: 0.80
       Rationale: Command can perform network operations: Supports port

File Operations:
  [MED] File operation capability: Can write files
       Risk: 0.50, Confidence: 0.85
       Rationale: Command can write files with risk level 0.5
  [LOW] File operation capability: Can read files
       Risk: 0.10, Confidence: 0.85
       Rationale: Command can read files with risk level 0.1

System Operations:
  [HIGH] System operation: Can access devices
       Risk: 0.80, Confidence: 0.90
       Rationale: Command performs system-level operation involving device
  [HIGH] System operation: Can manipulate processes
       Risk: 0.70, Confidence: 0.90
       Rationale: Command performs system-level operation involving process

Security Notes:
  [HIGH] Security note: Partial output blocks to character devices will
     produce a warning message...
       Risk: 0.80, Confidence: 0.95
       Rationale: Explicit security warning in man page documentation
  [LOW] Security note: EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
     Check that a disk drive contains no bad blocks:

           dd if=/dev...
       Risk: 0.30, Confidence: 0.95
       Rationale: Explicit security warning in man page documentation
