  "description": "in RFC 3986.\n\n       If you provide a URL without a leading p\bpr\bro\bot\bto\boc\bco\bol\bl:\b:/\b//\b/ scheme, curl guesses\n       what protocol you want. It then defaults to HTTP but assumes others\n       based on often-used hostname prefixes. For example, for hostnames\n       starting with \"ftp.\"  curl assumes you want FTP.\n\n       You can specify any amount of URLs on the command line. They are\n       fetched in a sequential manner in the specified order unless you use\n       _\b-_\bZ_\b, _\b-_\b-_\bp_\ba_\br_\ba_\bl_\bl_\be_\bl. You can specify command line options and URLs mixed and\n       in any order on the command line.\n\n       curl attempts to reuse connections when doing multiple transfers, so\n       that getting many files from the same server do not use multiple\n       connects and setup handshakes. This improves speed. Connection reuse\n       can only be done for URLs specified for a single command line\n       invocation and cannot be performed between separate curl runs.\n\n       Provide an IPv6 zone id in the URL with an escaped percentage sign.\n       Like in\n\n       \"http://[fe80::3%25eth0]/\"\n\n       Everything provided on the command line that is not a command line\n       option or its argument, curl assumes is a URL and treats it as such.",

For FTP, this can also be\n              enforced by using a URL that ends with \";type=A\".

The password can, still.\n\n              On systems where it works, curl hides the given option argument\n              from process listings. This is not enough to protect credentials\n              from possibly getting seen by other users on the same system as\n              they still are visible for a moment before cleared. Such\n              sensitive data should be retrieved from a file instead or\n              similar and never used in clear text in a command line.\n\n              When using Kerberos V5 with a Windows based server you should\n              include the Windows domain name in the username, in order for\n              the server to successfully obtain a Kerberos Ticket. If you do\n              not, then the initial authentication handshake may fail.\n\n              When using NTLM, the username can be specified simply as the\n              username, without the domain, if there is a single domain and\n              forest in your setup for example.\n\n              To specify the domain name use either Down-Level Logon Name or\n              UPN (User Principal Name) formats. For example, EXAMPLE\\user and\n              user@example.com respectively.\n\n              If you use a Windows SSPI-enabled curl binary and perform\n              Kerberos V5, Negotiate, NTLM or Digest authentication then you\n              can tell curl to select the username and password from your\n              environment by specifying a single colon with this option: \"-u\n              :\".\n\n              If --user is provided several times, the last set value is used.\n\n              Example:\n              curl -u user:secret https://example.com\n\n              See also _\b-_\bn_\b, _\b-_\b-_\bn_\be_\bt_\br_\bc and _\b-_\bK_\b, _\b-_\b-_\bc_\bo_\bn_\bf_\bi_\bg.\n\n       -A, --user-agent <name>\n              (HTTP) Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP server.\n              To encode blanks in the string, surround the string with single\n              quote marks. This header can also be set with the _\b-_\bH_\b, _\b-_\b-_\bh_\be_\ba_\bd_\be_\br\n              or the _\b-_\b-_\bp_\br_\bo_\bx_\by_\b-_\bh_\be_\ba_\bd_\be_\br options.\n\n              If you give an empty argument to _\b-_\bA_\b, _\b-_\b-_\bu_\bs_\be_\br_\b-_\ba_\bg_\be_\bn_\bt (\"\"), it\n              removes the header completely from the request. If you prefer a\n              blank header, you can set it to a single space (\" \").\n\n              By default, curl uses curl/VERSION, such as User-Agent:\n              curl/8.13.0.\n\n              If --user-agent is provided several times, the last set value is\n              used.\n\n              Example:\n              curl -A \"Agent 007\" https://example.com\n\n              See also _\b-_\bH_\b, _\b-_\b-_\bh_\be_\ba_\bd_\be_\br and _\b-_\b-_\bp_\br_\bo_\bx_\by_\b-_\bh_\be_\ba_\bd_\be_\br.\n\n       --variable <[%]name=text/@file>\n              Set a variable with \"name=content\" or \"name@file\" (where \"file\"\n              can be stdin if set to a single dash (\"-\")). The name is a case\n              sensitive identifier that must consist of no other letters than\n              a-z, A-Z, 0-9 or underscore. The specified content is then\n              associated with this identifier.\n\n              Setting the same variable name again overwrites the old contents\n              with the new.\n\n              The contents of a variable can be referenced in a later command\n              line option when that option name is prefixed with \"_\b-_\b-_\be_\bx_\bp_\ba_\bn_\bd_\b-\",\n              and the name is used as \"{{name}}\".\n\n              _\b-_\b-_\bv_\ba_\br_\bi_\ba_\bb_\bl_\be can import environment variables into the name space.\n              Opt to either require the environment variable to be set or\n              provide a default value for the variable in case it is not\n              already set.\n\n              _\b-_\b-_\bv_\ba_\br_\bi_\ba_\bb_\bl_\be %name imports the variable called \"name\" but exits\n              with an error if that environment variable is not already set.\n              To provide a default value if the environment variable is not\n              set, use _\b-_\b-_\bv_\ba_\br_\bi_\ba_\bb_\bl_\be %name=content or _\b-_\b-_\bv_\ba_\br_\bi_\ba_\bb_\bl_\be %name@content.\n              Note that on some systems - but not all - environment variables\n              are case insensitive.\n\n              Added in curl 8.12.0: you can get a byte range from the source\n              by appending \"[start-end]\" to the variable name, where _\bs_\bt_\ba_\br_\bt and\n              _\be_\bn_\bd are byte offsets to include from the contents. For example,\n              asking for offset \"2-10\" means offset two to offset ten,\n              inclusive, resulting in 9 bytes in total. \"2-2\" means a single\n              byte at offset 2. Not providing a second number implies to the\n              end of data. The start offset cannot be larger than the end\n              offset. Asking for a range that is outside of the file size\n              makes the variable contents empty.  For example, getting the\n              first one hundred bytes from a given file:\n\n              curl --variable \"fraction[0-99]@filename\"\n\n              Given a byte range that has no data results in an empty string.\n              Asking for a range that is larger than the content makes curl\n              use the piece of the data that exists.\n\n              To assign a variable using contents from another variable, use\n              _\b-_\b-_\be_\bx_\bp_\ba_\bn_\bd_\b-_\bv_\ba_\br_\bi_\ba_\bb_\bl_\be. Like for example assigning a new variable\n              using contents from two other:\n\n              curl --expand-variable \"user={{firstname}} {{lastname}}\"\n\n              When expanding variables, curl supports a set of functions that\n              can make the variable contents more convenient to use. You apply\n              a function to a variable expansion by adding a colon and then\n              list the desired functions in a comma-separated list that is\n              evaluated in a left-to-right order. Variable content holding\n              null bytes that are not encoded when expanded, causes an error.\n\n              Available functions:\n\n              trim   removes all leading and trailing white space.\n\n                     Example:\n\n                     curl --expand-url https://example.com/{{var:trim}}\n\n              json   outputs the content using JSON string quoting rules.\n\n                     Example:\n\n                     curl --expand-data {{data:json}} https://example.com\n\n              url    shows the content URL (percent) encoded.\n\n                     Example:\n\n                     curl --expand-url https://example.com/{{path:url}}\n\n              b64    expands the variable base64 encoded\n\n                     Example:\n\n                     curl --expand-url https://example.com/{{var:b64}}\n\n              64dec  decodes a base64 encoded character sequence. If the\n                     sequence is not possible to decode, it instead outputs\n                     \"[64dec-fail]\"\n\n                     Example:\n\n                     curl --expand-url https://example.com/{{var:64dec}}\n\n                     (Added in 8.13.0)\n\n\n              --variable can be used several times in a command line\n\n              Example:\n              curl --variable name=smith --expand-url \"https://example.com/{{name}}\"\n\n              Added in 8.3.0.

However,\n              as before, a single _\b-_\bv_\b, _\b-_\b-_\bv_\be_\br_\bb_\bo_\bs_\be or _\b-_\b-_\bn_\bo_\b-_\bv_\be_\br_\bb_\bo_\bs_\be reverts any\n              additions by previous \"-vv\" again. This means that \"-vv -v\" is\n              equivalent to a single -v. This avoids unwanted verbosity when\n              the option is mentioned in the command line _\ba_\bn_\bd curl config\n              files.\n\n              Using it twice, e.g. \"-vv\", outputs time (_\b-_\b-_\bt_\br_\ba_\bc_\be_\b-_\bt_\bi_\bm_\be) and\n              transfer ids (_\b-_\b-_\bt_\br_\ba_\bc_\be_\b-_\bi_\bd_\bs), as well as enable tracing for all\n              protocols (_\b-_\b-_\bt_\br_\ba_\bc_\be_\b-_\bc_\bo_\bn_\bf_\bi_\bg protocol).\n\n              Adding a third verbose outputs transfer content (_\b-_\b-_\bt_\br_\ba_\bc_\be_\b-_\ba_\bs_\bc_\bi_\bi\n              %) and enable tracing of more components (_\b-_\b-_\bt_\br_\ba_\bc_\be_\b-_\bc_\bo_\bn_\bf_\bi_\bg\n              read,write,ssl).\n\n              A forth time adds tracing of all network components.\n              (_\b-_\b-_\bt_\br_\ba_\bc_\be_\b-_\bc_\bo_\bn_\bf_\bi_\bg network).\n\n              Any addition of the verbose option after that has no effect.\n\n              If you think this option does not give you the right details,\n              consider using _\b-_\b-_\bt_\br_\ba_\bc_\be or _\b-_\b-_\bt_\br_\ba_\bc_\be_\b-_\ba_\bs_\bc_\bi_\bi instead. Or use it only\n              once and use _\b-_\b-_\bt_\br_\ba_\bc_\be_\b-_\bc_\bo_\bn_\bf_\bi_\bg to trace the specific components you\n              wish to see.\n\n              Note that verbose output of curl activities and network traffic\n              might contain sensitive data, including usernames, credentials\n              or secret data content. Be aware and be careful when sharing\n              trace logs with others.\n\n              When the output contains protocol headers, those lines might\n              include carriage return (ASCII code 13) characters, even on\n              platforms that otherwise normally only use linefeed to signify\n              line separations - as curl shows the exact contents arriving\n              from the server.\n\n              This option is global and does not need to be specified for each\n              use of --next.\n\n              Providing --verbose multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable\n              it again with --no-verbose.\n\n              Example:\n              curl --verbose https://example.com\n\n              This option is mutually exclusive with _\b-_\b-_\bt_\br_\ba_\bc_\be and\n              _\b-_\b-_\bt_\br_\ba_\bc_\be_\b-_\ba_\bs_\bc_\bi_\bi.

The format is a string that may contain plain text\n              mixed with any number of variables.  The format can be specified\n              as a literal \"string\", or you can have curl read the format from\n              a file with \"@filename\" and to tell curl to read the format from\n              stdin you write \"@-\".\n\n              The variables present in the output format are substituted by\n              the value or text that curl thinks fit, as described below. All\n              variables are specified as %{variable_name} and to output a\n              normal % you just write them as %%. You can output a newline by\n              using \\n, a carriage return with \\r and a tab space with \\t.\n\n              The output is by default written to standard output, but can be\n              changed with %{stderr} and %output{}.\n\n              Output HTTP header values from the transfer's most recent server\n              response by using _\b%_\bh_\be_\ba_\bd_\be_\br_\b{_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be_\b} where _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be is the case\n              insensitive name of the header (without the trailing colon). The\n              header contents are exactly as delivered over the network but\n              with leading and trailing whitespace and newlines stripped off\n              (added in 7.84.0).\n\n              Select a specific target destination file to write the output\n              to, by using _\b%_\bo_\bu_\bt_\bp_\bu_\bt_\b{_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be_\b} (added in curl 8.3.0) where _\bn_\ba_\bm_\be is\n              the full filename. The output following that instruction is then\n              written to that file. More than one _\b%_\bo_\bu_\bt_\bp_\bu_\bt_\b{_\b} instruction can be\n              specified in the same write-out argument. If the filename cannot\n              be created, curl leaves the output destination to the one used\n              prior to the _\b%_\bo_\bu_\bt_\bp_\bu_\bt_\b{_\b} instruction. Use _\b%_\bo_\bu_\bt_\bp_\bu_\bt_\b{_\b>_\b>_\bn_\ba_\bm_\be_\b} to\n              append data to an existing file.\n\n              This output is done independently of if the file transfer was\n              successful or not.\n\n              If the specified action or output specified with this option\n              fails in any way, it does not make curl return a (different)\n              error.\n\n              N\bNO\bOT\bTE\bE:\b: On Windows, the %-symbol is a special symbol used to\n              expand environment variables. In batch files, all occurrences of\n              % must be doubled when using this option to properly escape. If\n              this option is used at the command prompt then the % cannot be\n              escaped and unintended expansion is possible.\n\n              The variables available are:\n\n              certs  Output the certificate chain with details.
