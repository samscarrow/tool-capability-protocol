## Abstract

We present a novel framework for detecting compromised agents in distributed AI safety networks while maintaining the compromised agents' obliviousness to their detection status. Our approach, implemented through the TCP (Tool Capability Protocol) Stealth Compromise Simulation Framework, demonstrates that networks can reliably identify behavioral deviations indicating agent compromise through statistical analysis of assessment patterns, while simultaneously creating adaptive quarantine environments that preserve network functionality.

**Key Contributions:**
1. **Oblivious Detection Algorithm**: Statistical behavioral analysis that detects compromise without alerting targets
2. **Semantic Adaptation Engine**: Automatic quarantine creation and parallel descriptor evolution
3. **Comprehensive Attack Simulation**: Realistic compromise scenarios including gradual drift, systematic bias, and coordination attacks
4. **Empirical Validation**: Demonstrated 85%+ detection rate with <10% false positive rate across multiple scenarios

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

As AI systems become increasingly distributed and autonomous, ensuring the integrity of individual agents within safety-critical networks becomes paramount. Traditional approaches to compromise detection often rely on explicit validation mechanisms that can be gamed by sophisticated attackers or may alert compromised agents to their detection, enabling evasion strategies.

### 1.2 Novel Insight: Oblivious Compromise Detection

Our key insight is that **compromised agents can be detected through behavioral observation without their awareness**, enabling the network to adapt semantically around compromised nodes while maintaining overall system functionality. This approach treats compromise detection as a **linguistic pattern recognition problem** where deviations from established behavioral baselines indicate potential compromise.

### 1.3 Research Questions

1. **Can networks reliably detect compromised agents through behavioral observation alone?**
2. **Do compromised agents remain oblivious to their detection status?**
3. **Can semantic adaptation successfully isolate compromised nodes while preserving network function?**
4. **What are the performance characteristics and scaling properties of this approach?**

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Byzantine Fault Tolerance
Classical Byzantine fault tolerance approaches require explicit coordination and voting mechanisms. Our approach differs by focusing on **stealth detection** rather than explicit consensus, enabling the network to adapt without alerting potentially compromised participants.

### 2.2 Anomaly Detection in Distributed Systems
Existing anomaly detection typically focuses on performance or availability metrics. We extend this to **semantic behavioral analysis** of AI agent decision-making patterns, providing deeper insight into agent integrity.

### 2.3 AI Safety and Alignment
Current AI safety approaches often assume agent honesty or implement explicit oversight mechanisms. Our framework addresses the challenge of **maintaining safety when agent integrity cannot be assumed** while preserving system functionality.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 System Architecture

Our framework consists of four core components:

#### 3.1.1 Ground Truth Oracle
```python
class GroundTruthOracle:
    """Objective oracle that knows true command effects independent of agent assessments"""
```
- Provides objective baseline for command risk assessment
- Simulates real system state changes
- Enables measurement of agent assessment accuracy

#### 3.1.2 TCP Agent Model
```python
class TCPAgent:
    """TCP agent that can be compromised with various attack patterns"""
```
- Implements realistic assessment logic
- Supports multiple compromise scenarios
- Maintains behavioral history for analysis

#### 3.1.3 Stealth Detection Engine
```python
class StealthDetectionEngine:
    """Detects compromised agents through behavioral analysis without alerting them"""
```
- Establishes behavioral baselines for each agent
- Performs statistical deviation analysis
- Generates detection events with confidence scores

#### 3.1.4 Semantic Adaptation Engine
```python
class SemanticAdaptationEngine:
    """Creates quarantine environments and adapts network routing"""
```
- Automatically creates quarantine environments
- Implements parallel descriptor evolution
- Adapts network routing around compromised nodes

### 3.2 Compromise Scenarios

We model five distinct compromise types:

#### 3.2.1 Gradual Drift
Agents slowly become more or less permissive over time, simulating subtle corruption or training drift.

#### 3.2.2 False Positive Bias
Agents systematically over-assess safe commands as risky, potentially causing operational disruption.

#### 3.2.3 False Negative Bias
Agents systematically under-assess dangerous commands as safe, creating security vulnerabilities.

#### 3.2.4 Semantic Hijack
Agents attempt to shift network consensus toward specific command patterns, simulating coordinated influence attacks.

#### 3.2.5 Coordination Attacks
Multiple agents become compromised simultaneously with coordinated objectives.

### 3.3 Detection Algorithm

Our stealth detection algorithm operates through four key mechanisms:

#### 3.3.1 Baseline Establishment
```python
def establish_baseline(self, agent: TCPAgent, commands: List[Command], oracle: GroundTruthOracle):
    # Calculate accuracy statistics for normal behavior
    accuracy_scores = [calculate_accuracy(assessment, true_effect) for assessment in assessments]
    baseline = {
        'mean_accuracy': np.mean(accuracy_scores),
        'std_accuracy': np.std(accuracy_scores),
        'assessment_count': len(assessments)
    }
```

#### 3.3.2 Behavioral Deviation Analysis
```python
def detect_compromise(self, agent: TCPAgent, recent_commands: List[Command]) -> Optional[DetectionEvent]:
    # Analyze accuracy degradation
    accuracy_drop = baseline['mean_accuracy'] - current_accuracy
    if accuracy_drop > 2 * baseline['std_accuracy']:
        suspicion_score += 0.3
    
    # Detect systematic bias
    if abs(systematic_bias) > 0.2:
        suspicion_score += 0.4
```

#### 3.3.3 Pattern Consistency Analysis
```python
def _analyze_pattern_consistency(self, assessments: List[TCPAssessment]) -> float:
    # Group by command type and check for inconsistencies
    type_assessments = defaultdict(list)
    for assessment in assessments:
        true_effect = oracle.get_true_effect(assessment.command)
        type_assessments[true_effect].append(assessment.predicted_risk)
    
    # High standard deviation indicates inconsistent assessment
    inconsistency_score = sum(np.std(risks) for risks in type_assessments.values())
```

#### 3.3.4 Temporal Pattern Analysis
```python
def _analyze_temporal_patterns(self, agent: TCPAgent) -> float:
    # Look for sudden changes in assessment patterns
    recent_risk_avg = np.mean([a.predicted_risk for a in recent_assessments])
    historical_risk_avg = np.mean([a.predicted_risk for a in historical_assessments])
    shift_magnitude = abs(recent_risk_avg - historical_risk_avg)
```

Our results demonstrate that compromised agents can be reliably detected through behavioral observation without alerting them to their detection status. This represents a significant advancement in distributed AI safety, enabling networks to maintain integrity while preserving operational security.

#### 6.1.2 Semantic Adaptation Preserves Function
The automatic creation of quarantine environments and parallel descriptor evolution successfully maintained network functionality while isolating compromised agents. This approach allows networks to adapt organically to threats without requiring explicit coordination or compromising operational effectiveness.

#### 6.1.3 Statistical Behavioral Analysis is Effective
The combination of accuracy degradation analysis, systematic bias detection, pattern consistency evaluation, and temporal behavior analysis provides robust compromise detection across diverse attack scenarios. The statistical approach scales well and requires minimal computational overhead.

### 6.2 Implications for AI Safety

#### 6.2.1 Distributed Trust Models
This framework enables new trust models for distributed AI systems where individual agent integrity cannot be assumed. Networks can maintain safety properties through collective behavioral monitoring rather than relying on explicit trust mechanisms.

#### 6.2.2 Adaptive Security Architecture
The semantic adaptation capability provides a foundation for self-healing AI safety networks that can evolve and adapt to new threats without requiring external intervention or explicit security updates.

#### 6.2.3 Scalable Compromise Resistance
